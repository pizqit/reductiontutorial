A visual guide to using photo editing software to help plan and visualize the matrix states of a multi-layer reduction relief print


This guide uses Affinity Photo as the visual editor. Other photo editing programs have the same functionality, though their options may be in different locations and/or contain minor workflow differences.

The sample photograph used in this tutorial is my own photograph, taken in Florence, Italy.
